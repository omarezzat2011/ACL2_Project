**Why This Approach:**
- Duplicates can skew analysis results and model performance
- Missing essential data prevents meaningful analysis
- Clean data ensures reliable statistical calculations

### 2.2 Booking Data Dataset Cleaning

**Original Dataset:** 50,002 records, 14 columns

**Cleaning Steps:**
1. **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminated duplicate booking records
2. **Data Validation:** Verified data integrity and completeness

**Results:**
- Duplicates dropped: Variable count based on actual data
- Final dataset: Cleaned records ready for analysis
- Data retention: High percentage maintained

**Why This Approach:**
- Booking data was already clean with minimal missing values
- Focus on maintaining data integrity for accurate booking pattern analysis

---
**Datasets Dropped:**
- ❌ **Customer_comment.csv** - Dropped due to:
  - Redundant with main reviews dataset
  - Poor pre-computed sentiment analysis (0% positive sentiments)
  - Limited scope (food & beverage only)
  - Data quality issues

- ❌ **Survey data_Inflight Satisfaction Score.csv** - Dropped due to:
  - Not required for specified objectives
  - Different data structure and format
  - Adds complexity without clear benefit
  - String-to-numeric conversion issues

**Rationale for Dataset Selection:**
The selected datasets provide comprehensive coverage of all project requirements while maintaining data quality and analytical focus. The primary dataset contains all necessary features for sentiment analysis and predictive modeling, while the booking dataset provides essential flight hour distribution data.
